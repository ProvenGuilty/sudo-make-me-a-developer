**Real-world analogy:** Like combining edits from two different Word documents into one.

---

## O

### Open Source

**Example:** `C:\Users\YourName\Projects\my-project`  
**Real-world analogy:** Like a street address for files.

### Pull Request (PR)
**What it is:** Asking the owner of a repository to accept your changes.  
**Example:** Suggesting an improvement to this guide.  
**Real-world analogy:** Like suggesting an edit to a shared Google Doc.

### Push
**What it is:** Uploading your local changes to GitHub.  
**Example:** `git push` sends your commits to GitHub.  
**Real-world analogy:** Like uploading a file to Google Drive.

---

## R

### Repository (Repo)
**What it is:** A project folder that Git tracks, usually stored on GitHub.  
**Example:** This training project is a repository.  
**Real-world analogy:** Like a project folder in Google Drive, but with version history.

---

## S
