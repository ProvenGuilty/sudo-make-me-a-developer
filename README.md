> **From Zero to AI-Powered Coder: A Neck-Beard Approved Journey** 🧙‍♂️

Welcome, brave soul! You've stumbled upon the ultimate bootcamp for transforming from a complete noob into an AI-assisted developer. No prior coding experience? No Linux knowledge? Never touched an IDE? **Perfect.** You're exactly who this is for.

## 🎯 What Is This?

This is a hands-on, checkbox-driven training program that teaches you how to:
- Use modern development tools (IDEs, version control)
- Harness the power of AI to write code (aka "vibe coding")
- Build real projects with AI as your pair programmer
- Join the developer community and contribute back

Think of it as **leveling up from normie to wizard**, one chapter at a time.

## 🗺️ The Journey

### Chapter 1: Bootstrap Yourself (You Are Here!)
**Goal:** Get your development environment set up and understand the basics.

Choose your operating system:
- 🪟 **Windows:** [Chapter 1 (Windows): Bootstrap Yourself](./CHAPTER-1.md)
- 🍎 **macOS:** [Chapter 1 (macOS): Bootstrap Yourself](./CHAPTER-1-macos.md)

You'll learn (both paths):
- ✅ What an IDE is and why it matters
- ✅ Version control basics (Git & GitHub)
- ✅ How to use Windsurf IDE
- ✅ How to ask AI for help

Windows learners will also install **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**, while macOS learners set up **Xcode Command Line Tools + Homebrew**.

**Time Investment:** 1-2 hours  
**Difficulty:** Tutorial Island

👉 **[Start Chapter 1](./CHAPTER-1.md)**

### Chapter 2: Your First AI-Powered Project (Coming Soon)
**Goal:** Build something real using AI assistance.

You'll create a project based on YOUR entrepreneurial ideas. This chapter will be co-created by the community as people complete Chapter 1 and share what they want to build.

## 🤔 Who Is This For?

**You're in the right place if:**
- ✅ You can use Microsoft Office, Google Apps, or email
- ✅ You've heard of coding but never done it
- ✅ You've heard of Linux but never used it
- ✅ You want to build things with AI
- ✅ You're willing to learn and experiment
- ✅ You can follow step-by-step instructions

**You might want to look elsewhere if:**
- ❌ You're already a developer (though you might enjoy the AI techniques!)
- ❌ You want a traditional computer science education
- ❌ You're not comfortable with trial and error

## 🎮 How to Use This Guide

1. **Fork this repository** (we'll teach you how in Chapter 1)
2. **Follow the chapters in order** - they build on each other
3. **Check off boxes** as you complete steps
4. **Ask questions** in GitHub Issues if you get stuck
5. **Sign the guestbook** after finishing Chapter 1 to prove your setup works
6. **Contribute back** if you find better ways to explain things

## 🎓 Philosophy

This isn't about memorizing syntax or becoming a "10x engineer" overnight. It's about:
- **Learning by doing** - Build real things, not toy examples
- **AI as a teacher** - Use AI to explain, debug, and guide you
- **Community-driven** - We all learn together
- **Practical over theoretical** - Get stuff working first, understand deeply later
- **No gatekeeping** - Everyone starts somewhere
