# Origin Story: How This Project Came to Be

## The Original Prompt

This project was created from the following request:

---

> I want to create a super simple training program to bootstrap noobs into working in an ide and using gen ai models to vibe code. Chapter 1 is all I am focused on. Lets come up with a fun, neck-beard style project name. The outcome I'd like to see are super basic, lets assume a non-technical computer user that has never touched linux but knows of it, has never written code but knows of it, and has never used an IDE but has basic office software suite experience, such as microsoft office, google apps, email. etc.
>
> I'd like them to create a windsurf account, a github account and use those to learn the basics of what an IDE is, what version control is, and use windsurf to help them install WSL. That would be the end of chapter 1. You can go as deep as you want, I'd love to see easy to follow checkboxes, URLs to download the software and create necessary accounts, and that should get them bootstrapped to fully begin their AI journey. I want you to include this prompt in the documentation so we understand how we got here. Lets have them fork a repo so they can contribute back to the project if they found things that didn't work so well for their journey and what helped them achieve their goal.
>
> Once they've completed chapter 1, we'll have them create chapter 2 on their entrepreneureal ideas they would like to implement through use of genai. Whatever project name you come up with i'll create the github repo for you to commit to. I already have ssh keys installed for you to access and write them to.

## The Vision

The core idea is simple but powerful:
1. **Lower the barrier to entry** - Make coding accessible to complete beginners
2. **Leverage AI as a teacher** - Use modern AI tools to guide learning
3. **Community-driven evolution** - Let learners improve the content for future learners
4. **Practical outcomes** - Get people building real projects, not just learning theory

## Why "sudo make-me-a-developer"?

The name plays on the Linux `sudo` command (which elevates your privileges) and the `make` build tool. It's:
- **Playful** - Not taking itself too seriously
- **Accessible** - Self-explanatory even if you don't know Linux
- **Neck-beard approved** - Command-line aesthetic for the culture
- **Aspirational** - It's a command to transform yourself

## Design Principles

1. **Assume nothing** - If someone has only used Microsoft Office, start there
2. **Explain everything** - No jargon without definitions
3. **Checkboxes for progress** - Clear sense of accomplishment
4. **URLs for everything** - No hunting for where to sign up
5. **Fork-first approach** - Get people contributing from day one
6. **AI-assisted learning** - Use Windsurf/AI to teach AI-assisted development

## The Path Forward

- **Chapter 1**: Environment setup (GitHub, Windsurf, WSL)
- **Chapter 2**: Community-driven project ideas
- **Future Chapters**: Determined by what learners want to build

## Meta: Teaching by Example

This project itself is an example of AI-assisted development. The structure, content, and approach were created through collaboration between a human with a vision and an AI assistant. This is exactly the kind of "vibe coding" we're teaching.
